------------------------------------------------------------ Project 1: Quiz Game Based on User's Age ---------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================================================================================================
About the Game :  
This interactive quiz game is designed to engage users by tailoring the questions to their age group, creating a personalized and educational experience. 
Upon launching the game, users are prompted to enter their age, which then determines the set of questions presented to them. 
The quiz spans various topics, ensuring it is both age-appropriate and challenging. As users progress through the quiz, their responses are evaluated, and a total score is calculated at the end of the game.
To recognize participation and achievement, each user receives a digital certificate of participation, highlighting their total score.
This project not only demonstrates the effective use of conditional logic and user input handling in Python but also showcases the ability to create a dynamic and user-centric application.
